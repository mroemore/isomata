 * Contract and coverage macros, after the SQLite pattern (sqliteInt.h /
 * <https://sqlite.org/testing.html>).
 *
 * ALWAYS(X) / NEVER(X) mark a condition the author believes is invariantly
 * true / false. In a debug build they assert, so a supposedly impossible path
 * that is actually taken aborts loudly during testing instead of silently
 * corrupting state. In a release build they compile away to the bare
 * expression, so they cost nothing on the hot path.
 *
 *   if (NEVER(head == NULL)) return;   // "this must not happen"
 *   if (ALWAYS(idx >= 0)) use(idx);
 *
 * testcase(X) marks a branch that is reachable but not otherwise exercised by
 * the suite, so the coverage tool counts it as intentional. It is empty
 * unless ISOMATA_COVERAGE_TEST is defined; X must be side-effect free, because it
 * is not evaluated in non-coverage builds.

/*
 * Deterministic, dependency-free mutation testing for C.
 *
 * Classical mutation testing enables one mutation, runs the test suite, and
 * checks that it fails (a mutant "killed" by the suite). That needs an
 * operator-level toolchain we don't have here, so this does the cheaper
 * inverse: it mutates the *input* the code under test consumes, and the
 * suite's own assertions are the oracle. A mutant that survives is an input
 * malformation the tests do not react to.
 *
 * Why input bytes and not allocator bytes: an allocation-time flip is
 * overwritten by the very fread/copy that fills the buffer, so it never
 * reaches an asserted value. The loader's asserted values come from the file
 * contents, so that is what must be perturbed. (See TESTING.md I23/I25.)
 *
 * Everything is seeded, so a kill is reproducible from the reported seed and
 * mutation index. Configure from the environment (MUTATE_SEED / MUTATE_RATE),
 * or programmatically. See meson/mutate.sh.

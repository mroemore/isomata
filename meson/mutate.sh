#!/usr/bin/env bash
# meson/mutate.sh [test-name ...] [--quiet]
#
# Deterministic, dependency-free mutation testing. Every listed target is a
# self-contained input-mutation harness: it flips bits of the input the code
# under test consumes, runs the loader/parser, and requires its own assertions
# to notice. A survivor the target does not accept fails the target.
#
# Mutation is over *input bytes*, not allocator bytes: an allocation-time flip
# is overwritten by the very fread that fills the buffer, so it never reaches
# an assertion (TESTING.md I23). Input bytes are what the asserted values are
# derived from.
#
# Not Mull: there is no mutation tool on this box, gcc ships no sanitizer
# runtime, and a Mull toolchain would pin the compiler. The seeded, exhaustive
# harnesses run anywhere and need no plugin. They report a definite
# killed/survived count, and `--verbose` (MUTATE_VERBOSE) lists survivors.
#
# Targets are deterministic (they sweep, they do not sample), so there is no
# seed sweep here: MUTATE_SEED only matters when a harness chooses to sample.
